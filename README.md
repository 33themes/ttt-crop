Hacks
=====

Just copy&paste this code into your functions.php

*Remove sizes from the editor*

You can remove some sizes from the TTT Crop thumbnail editor with this code in your functions.php. 

Example code:

```php
    add_filter( 'tttcrop_image_sizes', 'custom_tttcrop_image_sizes');
    function custom_tttcrop_image_sizes( $sizes ) {
        unset( $sizes['thumbnail'] );
        unset( $sizes['large'] );
        return $sizes;
    }
```

*Set human names for the thumbnail names*

For example, the name "author-thumbnail" could be "Author Image" 


```php
    function local_ttt_crop_human_name($name) {
        switch( $name ) {
            case 'single-slider';
                return 'Home slider image'; break;
            case 'author-thumbnail';
                return 'Author Image'; break;

            default:
                return $name; break;
        }
    }
    add_filter('ttt_crop_human_name','local_ttt_crop_human_name');
```

*Show some of the sizes of one post_type*

In this example you existe the custom post type "author" and two image sizes
for the author content (single, archive, etc..). And you want to show only this
two image sizes on the crop screen. 

The idea is make more simple for the end user, don't show all the sizes, only
the sizes the user need.

```php
    add_action('init','custom_tttgallery_init',0);

    function custom_tttgallery_init() {
        global $pagenow;
        
        if ( 'admin-ajax.php' == $pagenow && $_REQUEST['action'] == 'ttt-crop_load' && isset($_REQUEST['post_id']) ) {
            if ( $post_type == 'author') {
                add_filter('tttcrop_image_sizes','custom_tttcrop_image_sizes_author');
            }
        }
    }

    function custom_tttcrop_image_sizes_author($sizes) {
        foreach ($sizes as $key => $values) {
            if ($key == 'author-thumbnail')
                $new[ $key ] = $values;
            elseif ($key == 'author-slider')
                $new[ $key ] = $values;
        }
        return $new;
    }
```
